Wallhaven Full Download
--

I just got tired having to go in each of the pics and then clicking "save as..." to download a wallpapers.

So, go to the website, do a search and then hover the pic you liked... click in the resolution pointed on the bottom of the thumb and et voil√°, you start your download :tada:
