Wallhaven Full Download (Chrome Extension)
--

I just got tired having to go in each of the pics and then clicking "save as..." to download a wallpapers.

So, go to the website, do a search and then hover the pic you liked... click in the resolution pointed on the bottom of the thumb and et voil√°, you start your download :tada:

## Install

1. Clone this project and import it as an "Unpacked Extension within Chrome" (If you don't see the option, click on "Developer Mode")
2. You're ready... get out of here.
